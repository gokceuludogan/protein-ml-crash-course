        "\n",
        "Protein structure prediction is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. The goal is to predict the **3D structure** of a protein given its **amino acid sequence**. Understanding a protein’s structure is key to determining its function and interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Explore the basics of protein structure prediction.\n",
        "- Understand the significance of **contact maps** and **distance matrices**.\n",
        "- Implement basic machine learning models to predict structural properties.\n",
        "- Discuss advanced techniques like **AlphaFold**, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for 3D structure prediction.\n",

        "### The Protein Folding Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids that fold into unique three-dimensional shapes. Predicting this 3D shape from the 1D amino acid sequence is called the **protein folding problem**. The structure of a protein is usually described at three levels:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Secondary structure**: Local folding into alpha helices and beta sheets.\n",
        "- **Tertiary structure**: Overall 3D shape of the protein.\n",

        "A **contact map** is a simplified representation of a protein’s 3D structure. It’s a 2D matrix where each element represents whether two amino acids are in contact in the 3D structure. Contact maps are widely used as intermediate steps in protein structure prediction.\n",

        "### Distance Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "A **distance matrix** is similar to a contact map but instead records the Euclidean distance between the Cα atoms (alpha carbon atoms) of amino acids. The distance matrix is key for reconstructing the 3D structure from 2D data.\n",

        "### Visual Example of a Contact Map:\n",
        "\n",
