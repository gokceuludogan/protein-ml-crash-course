        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Protein function prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics, where we aim to determine the biological role of a protein based on its sequence or structure. A popular framework for describing protein functions is the **Gene Ontology (GO)**. GO provides a structured vocabulary for annotating proteins, organized into three main categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Biological Process (BP)**: Pathways and processes a protein is involved in (e.g., cell cycle).\n",
        "- **Molecular Function (MF)**: Specific activities performed by the protein (e.g., binding).\n",
        "- **Cellular Component (CC)**: Locations within the cell where the protein operates (e.g., nucleus).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, we will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Introduce the Gene Ontology.\n",
        "- Explain how to prepare a dataset for GO-based function prediction.\n",
        "- Build machine learning models for predicting GO terms using sequence or structural features.\n",
        "- Evaluate the performance of these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction to Gene Ontology (GO)\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Gene Ontology?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Gene Ontology** is a hierarchical system that classifies protein functions using a controlled vocabulary. Each GO term describes a specific aspect of a protein's role in the cell, and these terms are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This allows for hierarchical relationships between general terms (e.g., \"metabolic process\") and specific ones (e.g., \"glycolysis\").\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key GO Categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Biological Process (BP)**: Pathways and larger processes (e.g., \"DNA repair\").\n",
        "- **Molecular Function (MF)**: Specific biochemical activities (e.g., \"ATP binding\").\n",
        "- **Cellular Component (CC)**: Where in the cell the protein is located (e.g., \"mitochondrion\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Each protein can be annotated with multiple GO terms across these categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Preparing a Dataset for Protein Function Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "We will assume we have a dataset where each protein sequence is associated with one or more GO terms. This dataset may include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Protein sequences\n",
        "- Known GO annotations (from BP, MF, or CC)\n",
        "\n",
        "| Sequence | GO Terms |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| MAGWELV | GO:0004674, GO:0005524, ... |\n",
        "| GGQVNLL | GO:0000166, GO:0004674, ... |\n",
        "\n",
        "The task is to predict the correct GO terms for new protein sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retrieving and Annotating Data with GO Terms\n",
        "We'll first retrieve protein sequences from UniProt SwissProt and annotate them with GO terms using UniProt-GOA. We will filter annotations based on the provided evidence codes (EXP, IDA, IMP, IGI, IEP, TAS, IC)."
